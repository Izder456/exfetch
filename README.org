/a system fetching utility aiming to be an extension to crfetch, written in elixir/

** Supported Operating Systems

- Linux
- FreeBSD
- GhostBSD
- OpenBSD
- NetBSD
  
** Why replicate Cr(y)fetch?

- *I needed an excuse to write elixir*

- *I wanted a crfetch-like fetch, but with more features*

** Why call it that?

Well I didn't mean to call it that. It was an unintended side effect. I'll just pretend it was an /ex/-tension to crfetch. Woo...

* Deps

- Elixir >= 1.15 (with escript set up/aliased to =escript= in =$PATH=)
  
* Build/Install

$ git clone https://github.com/izder456/exfetch
$ cd exfetch
$ mix compile
$ mix escript.build # installs bin to ./exfetch (not statically linked) 
#+END_SRC
